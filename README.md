ðŸ’» BMI Calculator â€“ Dynamic Web Application
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I developed a fully responsive and dynamic Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters), and upon clicking the "Calculate" button, it instantly computes the BMI value and displays the result with a category such as:

Underweight (BMI less than 18.5)

Normal weight (BMI between 18.5 and 24.9)

Overweight (BMI 25 and above)

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
Instant BMI Calculation: Automatically calculates the BMI as soon as the user submits their data.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and clean layout with clearly labeled fields and results.

Interactive Output: Displays meaningful messages based on BMI value with color-coded categories (e.g., green for normal, red for overweight).

Input Validation: Ensures only valid numeric input is accepted for weight and height.

Responsive Design: Works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
The project was built to demonstrate how core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) can be used to create practical, interactive applications. It reflects my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and responsive design principles.
